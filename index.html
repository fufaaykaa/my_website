            <p>Hi, my name is Malakhova Taisia (Taya), I am a Game Design student at the University of Europe for Applied Sciences in Berlin. I am 19 years old and I am from Russia.</p>
            <p>My journey into Game Design began almost 2 years ago. Before that, I had been a professional dancer for 12 years. Over time, I became fascinated by the IT world, which led me to explore programming, mathematics, and other technical fields. However, learning informatics was not enough for me, because I wanted to find a way to merge my technical skills with creativity.</p>
            <p>For my whole life, I've been drawn to different forms of art: I play piano, sing and record covers, love creative makeup, I am interested in painting and poetry, and also have a big background in the dancing industry. Therefore, when I learned about Game Design, it seemed like the perfect field for me, since it combines both technical skills and artistic expression.</p>
            <p>Every day I feel more confident about the choice I've made. There is still a lot to explore and learn about game development and my interests as a game designer, but I already know that I want to grow in this industry and share my ideas with people through the art of games.</p>
            <p>This website showcases the main projects I've worked on in the last two years, and I would really like to share them with you. Feel free to explore! And if you want, you can find more information about me on the <a href="about.html">About Me</a> page, and dive deeper into my projects on the <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> page. Enjoy!</p>
