                <h2>General Info</h2>
                <p>Hey! My name is Taya Malakhova, and I'm a Game Design student at the University of Europe for Applied Sciences in Berlin. 
                And on this page you can learn more about me not only as a game developer, but also as a person who is interested in various forms of art and loves combining creativity with technical 
                skills to build unique gaming experiences.</p>

                <h2>My Interests & Goals in Game Development</h2>
                <p>I would say that at my current state of experience and knowledge, I have one and main goal — to gain experience and expand my skill set. Also I really want to do more networking, because learning from experienced game developers, see where they started and how achieved a lot in the sphere, is the most efficient and inspiring way of learning for me. 
                    Besides that, somewhere in the future I want to create my own game development studio, where I will join together people who are close to my heart and whose ideas resonate with me. And I am sure that we will create some truly amazing content together.</p>

                        <h3>Music</h3>
                        <p>I play the piano and sing. I really enjoy combining both and recording covers. Unfortunately, here in Berlin, I don't have a piano, so I started learning to play the ukulele.</p>

                        <h3>Dancing</h3>
                        <p>I used to be a professional sports dancer and ended my career around four years ago. However, dancing will always be a part of my life and remains my hobby. Currently, I usually dance hip-hop and high-heels.</p>

                        <h3>Painting</h3>
                        <p>I'm not as educated in the field of painting as I would like to be, and I wish I knew more about famous artists and their works. However, I try to learn as much as possible because I'm genuinely fascinated by this form of art. My favorite painters are Vincent Van Gogh and Nicholas Roerich. While Van Gogh is widely recognized and needs no introduction, Roerich is less well-known. I admire his unique style and color palette. His experiences as a traveler, having seen countless breathtaking places, are beautifully reflected in his artwork.</p>
